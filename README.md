# AD9106
Arduino Library to interface with Analog Devices' EVAL-AD9106 DAC for arbitrary wave-form generation. Guided by code examples from [documentation page](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9106.html#eb-documentation)

Currently supports DDS sourced and pre-set waveforms. SRAM not modifiable.
